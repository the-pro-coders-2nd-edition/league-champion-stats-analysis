"""AI coach: rule-based recommendations ranked by statistical evidence.

Each rule inspects the aggregated data, and when a pattern is both material
(large effect) and statistically supported (low p-value where testable),
emits a :class:`~models.Recommendation`. Recommendations are prioritised by
a combination of effect size and significance.
